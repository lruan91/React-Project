    text: 'I remember taking Spanish classes all throughout high-school, but it wasn\'t engaging or fun. When I tried out Tootle Lingo, it made learning Spanish fun again! I was surprised how much I was able to learn and retain. I went to my local Mexican restaurant and was able to practice my new skills! Tootle Lingo is totally worth your time and I highly recommend it!'

The lessons they\'ve provided have been engaging and fun. I tried the free version first, but I liked it so much, I ended up getting the Monthly Plan to see what else it had and it\'s been great so far!'

    text: 'I had to learn some basic Mandarin Chinese for a business trip with my company and they recommended to use Tootle Lingo. I was able to pick up on the language in a fair amount of time and even read some basic characteres on my trip to China! The locals were impressed with my basic skills! I had a lot of fun conversing with the locals and my business partners while on my trip. Thanks Tootle Lingo!'

    text: 'I did a mission trip this past summer in Mexico and I bought so many dictionaries and phrase books, but they were so bulky and just added a lot of extra weight in my backpack. It was hard and boring to study just using the books and I noticed my friend with me on the trip able to use basic communication with the locals. I asked her what she was using and she recommended Tootle Lingo and said it was easy to use and she was picking up on things quickly. I gave it a try and I was able to practice what I learned way more than the books I bought. I can\'t wait to go back next summer and see how much more I\'ve improved. Totally worth it!'
